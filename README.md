## Overview

**ScoreKeeper** is a lightweight, responsive score-keeping web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple UI for tracking points for two players (or teams), with configurable winning score, increment/reset controls, and visual feedback.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**  
- **JavaScript** (vanilla JS, DOM manipulation, event handling)  
- **CSS3** (responsive layout, basic styling)

---

## Basic Info

### Purpose

> Provide a minimal, easy-to-use score tracker you can drop into a game night, classroom activity, or practice session.  
> Demonstrates clean separation of markup, styling, and logic while remaining easy to customize.

### Structure

- **index.html** — Main entry point, plain HTML markup for the UI
- **styles.css** — CSS for layout and responsive styling
- **script.js** — JavaScript for score state management, controls, and game rules

---

## Customization

- **Change player names, colors, and button labels** directly in the HTML.
- **Adjust winning score** via the UI control or change the default value in the JavaScript.
- **Modify styles** in the CSS to fit your brand or layout preferences.
- No build tools or external libraries required.
